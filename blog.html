        <h1 class="Trevor"> TREVOR NOARH BOOK</h1>
        <p class="Trevor1">Tsonga culture had a fundamental belief that a man owns the family and men are the ones to decide what he wants to do with the family.
            <br>Again in this culture women were supposed to bow when the great man women were just there for cooking food.So sad, Right? The same thing to Abel,<b>
                 he wanted traditional marriage with a traditional wife because he wanted to treat his wife in the same way as his culture. Abel couldn 't even question<br>
                  if what he was doing was correct, what he wanted was just respect while he is doing
            no sense in the community and everything around him. Unfortunately, Abel ended up falling in love with independent woman Patricia who had a very strong personality.

        <p class="Trevor2">Trevor Noah had a very bad life from his childhood Knowing that he was born illegally in a community, being hidden so that they can not punish his parents,<br>
             being only a colored person, etc. But Trevor Noah's personality was different from any other personality I have ever heard because he uses humor in very hard situations<br>
              which helps him move from difficult situations and make friends. If I give an example where he has put shit in the house everyone was afraid because they didn’t really<br>
               know the person who did that and Trevor was just there watching them and no one even guessed that it’s him. Another time I remember is when her mom brought for him a very<br>
                big cloth so that he would grow with them and the funny thing was that he had stopped growing by that time. Trevor now has used a hammer in the school, home, community to<br>
                 make friends and connect with other people since he belonged nowhere and everywhere as he said it by himself.
